# **What is bOS?**

bOS is strippied down, modified version of Windows 10. It is based around winver 22H2 (19045.2006 build).
It's an option to use to achieve better performance. reduced system latency, and overall better experience.

This is an open-source project.


# **The Difference**

bOS comes already debloated and pre-tweaked. Meaning you won't have to apply any extra tweaks outside of the ones already applied in bOS.
